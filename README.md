# Hotel-cancellation

Accurate booking cancellation prediction is crucial to hotel management, allowing the hotel to distribute 
resources efficiently. In this project, we aim to identify the important predictors related to booking cancellation 
and build an accurate model to predict cancellation. Various tree-based models were tested and tuned, 
including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The 
performance is assessed based on accuracy, precision and recall. Among all the models, random forest and 
the LGBM have the most outstanding performance. Considering the accuracy and ability to handle large 
datasets, the LGBM model will be our final choice.
